# Big Men Graphs
Scripts using data from basketball-reference.com player pages [such as this](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barklch01.html)
to create a number of graphs. I visualized the data in all sorts of ways, and I the think graphs tell an interesting story.

## Background
Basketball is my favorite sport, both to play and watch. In particular, I've always been a fan of the
**big man**, i.e., a true power-foward/center that can score and rebound. This is somewhat of a tribute to my
favorite NBA big men.
